# DefenSight Botnet Detector

DefenSight Botnet Detector is a cutting-edge supervised machine learning model specifically trained on network traffic data to detect botnet activity with unparalleled accuracy. Botnets pose a significant threat to networks worldwide, causing damages worth billions. However, with this solution, you can protect your network by detecting even the stealthiest botnets in real-time, ensuring your data and privacy remain uncompromised. Botnet detector is capable of detecting a wide range of botnet behaviors, including Command and Control (C&C) communication, malware distribution, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.

## Highlights
1. DefenSight Botnet detector facilitates an important aspect of abnormal behavior profiling in cycbersecurity using machine learning to enable early detection of botnet activity in the network and facilitates the in-time remedial measures.
2. Botnet detector offers a cutting-edge cyberdefense mechanism for diverse sectors, including finance, healthcare, retail, industrial, government and more.
